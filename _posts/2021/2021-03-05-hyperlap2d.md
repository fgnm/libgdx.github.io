Many libGDX lovers may remember the [Overlap2D](https://github.com/UnderwaterApps/overlap2d) tool, which was unfortunately discontinued some years ago. HyperLap2D aims to be a modern replacement for this tool.


One serious disadvantage of using a low-level framework, such as libGDX, is that all graphics stuff has to be coded along with the game logic. Sometimes this might be good, but in complex games this aspect quickly becomes slow and annoying, since it forces graphic and level designers to work with code. Usually, developers create their own solutions according to their game needs, however this might be time consuming as well. HyperLap2D is a general-purpose visual editor that helps you describe complex scenes with an _easy to use_ drag and drop UI along with many useful tools. It doesn't contain any business logic, just a pure description of all graphical assets.


The output is a series of JSON files, completely independent from code, that can be loaded at runtime anywhere: in a standard libGDX project, derivate libGDX works or even in a completely different framework/game engine.

# libGDX Runtime

HyperLap2D comes with an official [runtime](https://github.com/rednblackgames/hyperlap2d-runtime-libgdx) for libGDX, an engine-like library that has everything you need to parse JSON files and work with your scenes.


It's based on Ashley ECS, with a built-in rendering system, entity factories, tween actions and much more!


The runtime can be used in any type of libGDX project: LWJGL2/3, Android, RoboVM and GWT. Some useful information can be found in the [Getting Started](https://github.com/rednblackgames/HyperLap2D/wiki/libgdx---Getting-Started) wiki and in [Working Example](https://github.com/rednblackgames/hyperlap2d-getting-started).

# Development status

Currently, HyperLap2D is in Alpha stage and it's under heavy development. All features are working and many others will be [added soon](https://github.com/rednblackgames/HyperLap2D/projects/1). However, some aspects might not be stable and there is still a huge room for improvement of the overall system. If you have some cool additions or bug fixes, don't hesitate to create an issue or a pull request. Any contribution, big or small, is always well received.
